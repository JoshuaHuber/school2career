Summary
--------------------

The project is going to be built in phases. The first phase will be creating a basic college finder. Given certain parameters like city/state or zip, we will pull up colleges in a given area. From there it can be fine tuned within a given radius, and choices based on degree interested in as well as searching for a specific college. 

The second phase will be about helping students find possible career paths. Based on some form of assessment test, we will provide a list of careeers as well as some basic info about those careersk that may help a potential student make decisions about their future.

The idea for this came about with the idea that most students have no idea what they want to study and, there are so many jobs out there that most people would have no idea even exist. So when faced with making this kind of decision, it is our goal to help offer suggestions based on general interests and areas that a person feels they are strong in.
